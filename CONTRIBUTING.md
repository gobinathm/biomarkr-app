#### Pull Request Process
1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards:
   - Use TypeScript with strict typing
   - Follow existing component patterns
   - Write descriptive commit messages
   - Include comments for complex logic
   - Ensure responsive design
   - Test in demo mode

3. **Test thoroughly**:

   npm run lint          # Check code style
   npm run type-check    # TypeScript validation
   npm run build         # Ensure it builds
   ```

4. **Commit with conventional format**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new biomarker panel for microbiome analysis"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve profile switching issue in demo mode"
   git commit -m "docs: update deployment instructions for mobile"
   ```

5. **Push and create PR**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Fill out PR template** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Testing performed
   - Screenshots (if UI changes)
   - Breaking changes (if any)

## üéØ Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Components**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions
- **Files**: Match component names, use kebab-case for utilities
- **Imports**: Group by type (external, internal, relative)
- **CSS**: Use Tailwind classes, avoid custom CSS when possible

### Health Data Considerations
- **Privacy First**: No data should leave the user's device by default
- **Medical Accuracy**: Ensure biomarker references are medically accurate
- **Accessibility**: Health apps must be accessible to all users
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid health data
- **Disclaimers**: Always include appropriate medical disclaimers

### Component Structure
```typescript
// components/NewComponent.tsx
interface NewComponentProps {
  data: HealthData[];
  onAction: (id: string) => void;
}

export function NewComponent({ data, onAction }: NewComponentProps) {
  // Component logic
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Adding New Biomarkers
```typescript
// In mockData.ts
case 'New Panel Name':
  biomarkers = [
    { 
      name: 'Biomarker Name', 
      value: 'calculated_value', 
      unit: 'unit', 
      referenceRange: { min: 0, max: 100 },
      range: '0-100 unit'
    }
  ];
  break;
```

## üè• Health & Medical Guidelines

### Medical Accuracy
- Reference ranges must be clinically accurate
- Use established medical sources (LabCorp, Quest, Mayo Clinic)
- Include appropriate units and conversion factors
- Consider age, gender, and population variations

### Data Privacy
- Never log sensitive health data
- Use generic examples in code comments
- Implement proper data sanitization
- Follow HIPAA principles even for personal use

### User Safety
- Include medical disclaimers
- Don't provide medical advice
- Encourage professional consultation
- Handle edge cases gracefully
